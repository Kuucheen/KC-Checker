> Your terminal needs to support true color, and using different fonts in your terminal may cause display errors.

These are tested terminals on different operating systems:

| System | Tested | Notes |
|--|--|--|
| Windows 11| <div align="center">✅</div> | Works fine |
| Windows 10 | <div align="center">✅</div> | Works without true color

# Getting started

Download [latest release](https://github.com/Kuucheen/KC-Checker/releases/) & unzip the file

**Windows**<br>
Double click on KC-Checker.exe

3. **(OPTIONAL) Set Up GeoLite2 Database:**
   If you want to determine the country and type (ISP, Datacenter, or Residential) of the proxies, you'll need to download the [GeoLite2 Country and GeoLite2 ASN Database](https://dev.maxmind.com/geoip/geolite2-free-geolocation-data) from MaxMind.

   - After downloading, replace the existing databases in the `helper` directory.
   - Ensure they have the same names: `GeoLite2-ASN.mmdb` and `GeoLite2-Country.mmdb`.<br><br>

   > **Note**: These databases are not included in the repository due to their licensing restrictions. However, they are bundled in the [prebuilt version](https://github.com/Kuucheen/KC-Checker/releases/).
